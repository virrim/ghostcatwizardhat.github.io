	<h1>HELLO AND WELCOME TO HTM-HELL</h1>
	<hr />
	<p>Pretty soon this page is gonna be full of the most wonderful and amazing shit you ever injected into your mind via your sight-spheres. That being said, some may question the content of this site.<br />
	<b>REMEMBER:</b>
	<ol>
	<li>The creator(s) of this content has/have FEELINGS*</li>
	<li>I love IRONY**</li></ol>
	</p>
	<hr />
	<p>* These feelings are mostly of self-pity and loathing already (edgy, right?) so your contribution is unnecessary and will only contribute to entropy and the hyped and heavily-awaited, eventual HEAT DEATH OF THE UNIVERSE.
	<br /><br />
	** The level of IRONY is subjective to the bystander and may reach a level high enough that it becomes cringe-worthy. In this case, the use of IRONY becomes ironic in itself and so it shall be treated as an ART***.
	<br /><br />
	***<b>REMINDER:</b> Just because something is art does not mean it is beautiful, good in any way, nor contributing to humanity in any way other to aid in the highly-anticipated HEAT DEATH.</p>
