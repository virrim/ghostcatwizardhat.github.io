    <h1>Welcome Home.</h1>
    <hr>
    <p class="CaviarDreams-Body">Hello world!</p>
    <p>Pretty soon this page is gonna be full of the most wonderful and amazing
      shit you ever injected into your mind via your sight-spheres. That being
      said, some may question the content of this site.<br>
      <b>REMEMBER:</b> </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The creator(s) of this content has/have FEELINGS*</li>
      <li>I love IRONY**</li>
    </ol>
    <hr>
    <p>* These feelings are mostly of self-pity and loathing already (edgy,
      right?) so your contribution is unnecessary and will only contribute to
      entropy and the hyped and heavily-awaited, eventual HEAT DEATH OF THE
      UNIVERSE. <br>
      <br>
      ** The level of IRONY is subjective to the bystander and may reach a level
      high enough that it becomes cringe-worthy. In this case, the use of IRONY
      becomes ironic in itself and so it shall be treated as an ART***. <br>
      <br>
      ***<b>REMINDER:</b> Just because something is art does not mean it is
      beautiful, good in any way, nor contributing to humanity in any way other
      to aid in the highly-anticipated HEAT DEATH.</p>
