Well, I guess this is the first time I'm really going to consider this thing acceptable?<br>
To anyboody looking at the code for whatever reason, I'm sorry. It doesnt make sense to me either heheh.<br>
<br>
&lt;-- and why is there so much SPACE to the right of those links??<br>
<br>
I hope this site contains some enjoyable content at least.<br>
For you I mean.<br>
And while I doubt it will, hopefully it encourages me to do more as well.<br>

Singing off for now, --herb
