Cowboy Bebop is a golden standard. That's really all there is. You know that hipster that dislikes whatever is popular in the world? Even they like cowboy bebop, just like everyone else. There is nothing wrong with it. It's just that good.<br>
<br>
"But what is Cowboy Bebop?" you ask eagerly, your eye spheres bulging with anticipation and curious excitement, the likes of which never felt before by no mortal. Well dear reader, if I may refer to you as that (and it's my site, so I will), Cowboy Bebop takes place in the DISTANT FUTURE- 2071 to be exact though the level of tech that appears suggests we have much catching up to do. Space-travel is not only common but a daily ordeal for many-a-person and aliens to Earth go about their average lives throughout the galaxy. Even the ability to create wormholes and make light-year long trips take mere seconds has been achieved and is also used quite commonly. "But where's the frickin' beboy cowbop?!?" Well calm yourself son, WE"LL GET THERE.<br>
<br>
And we'll get there at about here. Imagine a dude who is a space cowboy. Now remove the lasso and the horse and the space-suit and the cowboy hat and every cowboy/space-related thing you can think of. Give him a casual suit and a big ol' spaceship and YOU GOT YERSELF A SPACE COWBOY. Spike, the cowboy in question (that I have now answered), seems to have a pretty dumb name when you first think about it but it fits naturally in as you really get in to the show. There are a bunch of other characters too and he accrues a team as the episodes unfold with each character getting enough development to leave you feeling satisfied and not underwhelmed- even with the overarching storyline which is revealed through Spike's traveling through the galaxy which the show overall centers around.<br>
<br>
10/10- I'll say it again, a golden standard.
